# Barstool Full Stack Challenge
![](https://i.imgur.com/TkoejSQ.png)

### Description
- Challenge to create a boxscore widget that displays a sport's outcome based on data fed to it by an API
- Created using personalized webpack config and react boilerplate

### To Run
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/alexanderMontague/takehomes`
- CD into the correct project `cd Barstool`
- install dependencies using preferred method `yarn` or `npm i`
- run the application (will automatically open in browser) `yarn start` or `npm run start`

### Limitations
- The API seemed somewhat incomplete at the time, so I was not able to display all of the info based on the css given.
- One case of this is when the scores for the soccer match do not add up, as we only had goal data for a few of the goals
- EDIT: Seems like the API for the challenge changed during development :/ did the best I could
